              diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive

  abstract = "The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of big team science
              (BTS), endeavours where a comparatively large number of
              researchers pool their intellectual and/or material resources in
              pursuit of a common goal. Despite this burgeoning interest, there
              exists little guidance on how to create, manage and participate
              in these collaborations. In this paper, we integrate insights
              from a multi-disciplinary set of BTS initiatives to provide a
              how-to guide for BTS. We first discuss initial considerations for
              launching a BTS project, such as building the team, identifying
              leadership, governance, tools and open science approaches. We
              then turn to issues related to running and completing a BTS
              project, such as study design, ethical approvals and issues
              related to data collection, management and analysis. Finally, we
              address topics that present special challenges for BTS, including
              authorship decisions, collaborative writing and team
              decision-making.",
