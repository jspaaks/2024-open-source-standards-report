# Abstract

Recent progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence promises to
advance research and understanding across a wide range of fields and
activities. In tandem, increased awareness of the importance of open data for
reproducibility and scientific transparency is making inroads in fields that
have not traditionally produced large publicly available datasets. Data sharing
requirements from publishers and funders, as well as from other stakeholders,
have also created pressure to make datasets with research and/or public
interest value available through digital repositories. However, to make the
best use of existing data, and facilitate the creation of useful future
datasets, robust, interoperable and usable standards need to evolve and adapt
over time. The open-source development model provides significant potential
benefits to the process of standard creation and adaptation. In particular, the
development and adaptation of standards can use long-standing socio-technical
processes that have been key to managing the development of software, and allow
incorporating broad community input into the formulation of these standards. By
adhering to open-source standards to formal descriptions (e.g., by implementing
schemata for standard specification, and/or by implementing automated standard
validation), processes such as automated testing and continuous integration,
which have been important in the development of open-source software, can be
adopted in defining data and metadata standards as well. Similarly, open-source
governance provides a range of stakeholders a voice in the development of
standards, potentially enabling use cases and concerns that would not be taken
into account in a top-down model of standards development. On the other hand,
open-source models carry unique risks that need to be incorporated into the
process.
