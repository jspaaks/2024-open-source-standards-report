This repository contains the materials to generate a report following the April

There are several different ways to provide contributions:

1. This repository uses [quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
to render both a [website](https://uwescience.github.io/2024-open-source-standards-report/) and
a [pdf](https://uwescience.github.io/2024-open-source-standards-report/index.pdf)
of the report. If you are comfortable making your suggestions and edits through GitHub, please do so.  To contribute to the contents of the report, please edit the `.qmd` files that are stored under the `sections` directory. You can also add bibliographic items in the bibtex format to the `references.bib` file. See more below for information about citations and the quarto markdown format. If you contribute in this manner, please also add your author metadata to the `metadata.yml` file.

You can download it and mark it up in whatever software you prefer to use and send it to Ariel (arokem@uw.edu) and Anshul (anshul37@uw.edu) to be integrated.

### Citations in markdown

To cite source material, use the following syntax: `[@key1]`, where `key1` is the
bibtex key for the entry that you would like to cite. You can also cite two
items in the same position, by using the following: `[@key1, @key2]`.
