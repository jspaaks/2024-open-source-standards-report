# Recommendations for open-source data and metadata standards {#sec-recommendations}

In conclusion of this report, we propose the following recommendations:

## Policy-making and Funding entities:

### Fund Data Standards Development

While some funding agencies already support standards development as part of
the development of informatics infrastructures, data standards development
should be seen as integral to science innovation and earmarked for funding in
research grants, not only in specialized contexts. Funding models should
encourage the development and adoption of standards, and fund associated
community efforts and tools for this. The OSS model is seen as a particularly
promising avenue for an investment of resources, because it builds on
previously-developed procedures and technical infrastructure and because it
provides avenues for the democratization of development processes and for
community input along the way. The clarity offered by procedures for
enhancement proposals and semantic versioning schemes adopted in standards
development offers avenues for a range of stakeholders to propose well-defined
contributions to large and field-wide standards efforts (e.g.,
[@pestilli2021community]).

### Invest in Data Stewards

Advancing the development and adoption of open-source standards requires the
dissemination of knowledge to researchers in a variety of fields, but this
dissemination itself may not be enough without the fostering of specialized
expertise. Therefore, it is important to recognize the distinct role that *data
stewards* play in contemporary research. As policy demands for openness become
increasingly high, it is crucial to truly support experts whose role will be to
develop, maintain, and facilitate the adoption and use of open-source
standards. This support needs to manifest in all stages of the career of these
individuals: it will be necessary to set up programs for training for data
stewards, and to invest in the career paths of individuals that receive such
training so that this crucial role is encouraged. Initial proposals for the
curriculum and scope of the role have already been proposed (e.g., in
[@Mons2018DataStewardshipBook]), but we identify here also a need to connect
these individuals directly to the practices that exemplify open-source
standards. Thus, it will be important for these individuals to be facile in the
methodology of OSS. This does not mean that they need to become software
engineers -- though for some of them there may be some overlap with the role of
research software engineers [@Connolly2023Software] -- but rather that they
need to become familiar with those parts of the OSS development life-cycle that
are specifically useful for the development of open-source standards. For example, tools for version control, tools for versioning, and tools for creation and validation of compliant data and metadata.

### Review Data Standards Pathways

Invest in programs that examine retrospective pathways for establishing data
standards. Encourage publication of lifecycles for successful data standards.
These lifecycles should include the process, creators, affiliations, grants,
and adoption journeys of open-source standards. To encourage sustainable
development of open-source standards, and to build on prior experience, the
documentation and dissemination of lifecycles should be seen as an integral
step of the work of standards creators and granting agencies. In the meanwhile,
it would be good to also retroactively document the lifecycle of existing
standards that are seen as success stories. Research on the principles that
underlie successful open-source standards development can be used to formulate
new standards and iterate on existing ones.

### Establish Governance

Establish governance for standards creation and adoption, especially for
communities beyond a certain size that need to converge toward a new standard
or rely on an existing standard. Review existing governance practices such as
[TheOpenSourceWay](https://www.theopensourceway.org/the_open_source_way-guidebook-2.0.html#_project_and_community_governance).
Data management plans should promote the sharing of not only data, but also
metadata and descriptions of how to use it.


### Program Manage Cross Sector alliances

Encourage cross-sector and cross-domain alliances that can impact successful
standards creation. Invest in robust program management of these alliances to
align pace and create incentives (for instance via Open Source Program Office /
OSPO efforts). Similar to program officers at funding agencies, standards
evolution need sustained PM efforts. Multi company partnerships should include
strategic initiatives for standard establishment e.g.
[Pistoiaalliance](https://www.pistoiaalliance.org/news/press-release-pistoia-alliance-launches-idmp-1-0/).


### Curriculum Development

Stakeholder organizations should invest in training grants to establish curriculum for data and metadata standards education. </ol>

## Science and Technology Communities:

### User-Driven Development

Standards should be needs-driven and developed in close collaboration with users. Changes and enhancements should be in response to community feedback.

### Meta-Standards development

In surveying the landscape of existing standards, a readiness/maturity model
can be developed that assesses the challenges and opportunities that a specific
standard faces. This process in itself can be standardized to develop
meta-standards or standards-of-standards. These are the succinct descriptions
of cross-cutting best-practices that can be used as a basis for the analysis or
assessment of an existing standard, or as guidelines to develop new standards.
For instance, barriers to adopting a data standard irrespective of team size
and technological capabilities should be considered. Meta-standards should
include formalization for versioning of standards and interactions with
specific related software. Aspects of communication with potential user
audiences (e.g., researchers in particular domains) should be taken into
account as well. For example, in the quality of onboarding documentation and
tools for ingestion or conversion into standards-compliant datasets. Relatedly,
it would be good to create an ontology for standards process such as top down
vs bottom up, minimum number of datasets, target community size and technical
expertise typical of this community, etc. This ontology can help guide the
standards-development process towards more effective adoption and use.


### Formalization Guidelines

Amplify formalization/guidelines on how to create standards (example metadata schema specifications using [LinkML](https://linkml.io).

### Landscape and Failure Analysis

Before establishing a new standard, survey and document failure of current standards for a specific dataset / domain. Use resources such as [Fairsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) or [Digital Curation Center](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards).

### Machine Readability

Development of standards should be coupled with development of associated software. Make data standards machine readable, and software creation an integral part of establishing a standard's schema e.g. For identifiers for a person using CFF in citations, cffconvert software makes the CFF standard usable and useful.
Additionally, standards evolution should maintain software compatibility, and ability to translate and migrate between standards.
